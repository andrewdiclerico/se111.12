            <p class="tab">After invading Normandy, Captain Miller assembles a squad to find Private Ryan. The movie doesnt just capture the mission to find Private Ryan. Along with the mission to find Private Ryan, the movie also captures the horrors of war throughout the mission.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="tab"><em>Saving Private Ryan</em> begins with the invasion of Normandy. The soldiers storm the beach and capture it. After the beach is captured the camera pans across the beach to show the sheer amount of soldiers that gave their lives in just this one part of the war. This is also the place where one of Private Ryan's brothers lies dead. </p>
            
            <br>

            <p class="tab">The squad sets off on their mission and encounter a a german family asking to take their child. Private Caparzo reaches for the child and is shot by a sniper in the process. While Private Jackson takes out the sniper, Private Caparzo bleeds out while his fellow soldiers watch from behind cover, unable to help.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p class="tab">Captain Miller and his squad track Private James Francis Ryan down to Remelle, where Captain Miller tells Ryan that his brothers have died in combat. Private Ryan chooses to stay with 'the brothers he has left' and fight in Ramelle. This is where Captain Miller and many others die.</p>
